# NimNotebook
A pure Nim implementation of Jupyter Notebook, powered by Nimscript. Nim Notebook allows you to create documents that contain live code, visualizations and narrative text.

> Nim Notebook is web application that doubles as a browser-based IDE and a presentation tool. The goal is to create a feature-rich live coding environment for data science, machine learning, and many other applications.

This project was inspired by Nim programmer PMunch, with his ![embedded Nimscript](https://peterme.net/using-nimscript-as-a-configuration-language-embedding-nimscript-pt-1.html) series.
