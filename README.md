# NimNotebook
A Jupyter Notebook-like IDE for Nim. Nim Notebook allows you to create documents that contain live code, visualizations and narrative text.

> Nim Notebook is a web application that doubles as a browser-based IDE and a presentation tool. The goal is to create a feature-rich live coding environment for data science, machine learning, and many other applications.

Nim Notebook works with `nim secret` as the REPL, however we plan on adding `inim` as another option in the near future.
